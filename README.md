# Full Circle

A prototype for an image-recognition game, this Rust project distorts an uploaded image by abstracting it through pixelation, using extremely coarse-grained circles at first. The program uses an evolutionary algorithm which approximates the input by reading the imageâ€™s colours and then layers matching circles on a blank canvas. The image is refined over time, making it more recognizable. [Check it out here](https://circles-lovat.vercel.app/).
